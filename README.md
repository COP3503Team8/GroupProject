#The Legend of Liu

<h1> Overview </h1>
<p>
There once was a student named Harrison who had trouble in COP3503. The only way he would be able to pass the course would be to fight Dr. Liu in a one-on-one programming battle. Harrison decided to embark on the journey to Dr. Liu's office to confront him one and for all. On his way, he encountered the ghosts of Liu's past, failed student, who were determined to make him one of them. Guarding each entrance to the next floor were numerous authorities such as the TAs and the advisors. With packets of Smokin' Notes to restore his fortitude, can Harrison succeed in taking down the almighty Liu?
